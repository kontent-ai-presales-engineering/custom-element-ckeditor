# CK Editor Custom Element for Kentico Kontent

This is a [custom element](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/integrate/integrating-your-own-content-editing-features) for [Kentico Kontent](https://kontent.ai) that allows users to generate rich text output in a form of HTML via the popular CK Editor. The editor is capable of loading any valid HTML input, the output value is also being saved as pure HTML.

## Capabilities

### Autosaving

Content of the element is being periodically saved every 10 seconds as you type and also when the element becomes inactive (e.g. you click on a different element).

### Asset Library integration

The editor supports inserting images from the Kentico Kontent Asset Library.

### Dynamic hyperlink building

Editor allows users to link already created content items in a form of hyperlinks directly to the written text.

The link is being generated from the `itemUrlMacro` (see [parameters section](#json-parameters)), where it replaces the `{codename}` parameter for the codename of the selected content item. If the linked content item is removed or has its codename changed, the hyperlink won't be automatically updated and will break - all changes have to be propagated manually!

## Setup

1. Deploy the code to a secure public host
    * See [deploying section](#Deploying) for a really quick option
1. Follow the instructions in the [Kentico Kontent documentation](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/integrate/integrating-your-own-content-editing-features#a-3--displaying-a-custom-element-in-kentico-kontent) to add the element to a content model.
    * The `Hosted code URL` is where you deployed to in step 1
    * Pass the necessary parameters as directed in the [JSON Parameters configuration](#json-parameters) section of this readme.

## JSON Parameters

There are two JSON Parameters accepted by the element.

1. The `itemUrlMacro` is described above and is used to create absolute hyperlinks from selected content items. This parameter is required once you plan on using this functionality.
2. The `toolbar` parameter is optional and lets you completely customize the editor's toolbar. If no toolbar parameter is present, the editor will use its default one containing all the options provided below.
